These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. The Maximin Grunhauser Riesling Abstberg Grosses Gewachs with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 63 dollars per bottle.",

            "description": "Grunhaus is relatively new to GG production, having only joined the VDP (Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter) in 2015. They make two GGs - Herrenberg and Abstberg. Abtsberg reigns supreme, derived from deep blue slate soils. It exhibits telltale aromas and flavors of white peach, apricot, spring flowers and green herbs. A thrilling streak of citrusy acidity wakes up the palate and reveals the deep mineral and herbal facets of this extraordinary complex Riesling. There is no lack of fruit - the peach, apple and mango shine throughout - but it’s the haunting earthiness and filigreed detail of this wine that makes it unforgettable.",

If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny.

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade).

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit.

However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol\">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.",

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."
